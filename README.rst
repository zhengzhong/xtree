xtree - a C++ wrapper for libxml2
---------------------------------

**xtree** is a C++ wrapper for the popular `libxml2 <http://xmlsoft.org/>`_ XML parser library.
Though libxml2 is famous for its high performance and compliance to standard specifications,
its C API is quite difficult to use. Built on top of libxml2, xtree provides an easy-to-use,
STL-like API for accessing and manipulating the underlying DOM tree.
