/** \mainpage xtree - a C++ wrapper for libxml2

 <b>xtree</b> is a C++ wrapper for the popular <a href="http://xmlsoft.org/">libxml2</a> XML parser
 library. Though libxml2 is famous for its high performance and compliance to standard
 specifications, its C API is quite difficult to use. Built on top of libxml2, xtree provides an
 easy-to-use, STL-like API for accessing and manipulating the underlying DOM tree.
