\section header_files  Header Files

Before using xtree, you need to include the appropriate header file(s) into your source code.
The xtree project provides the following header files:

<b><code>xtree/xtree.hpp</code></b>

This header file contains the xtree classes and functions. Typically this is the only header file
that you need to pull into your source code.

<b><code>xtree/xtree_fwd.hpp</code></b>

This header file contains forward declarations of the xtree components.

<b><code>xtree/auto_link.hpp</code></b>

This header file will activate auto-linking to the appropriate xtree library.
